simplest-blockchain
===================

This repository is a compilation of very simple implementations in Python of a 
blockchain for educational purposes. 

You can run any of these blockchain code examples directly with the Python 
interpreter:

.. code:: bash

	$ python blockchain.v1.py

Here's the overview:

blockchain.v1.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplest implementation of all, introduces the notion of blockchain as a chain 
of blocks (locally stored in an array) and the concept of hashing. There is one 
single node that generates a first set of 20 blocks at once, and prints them 
out.
